This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks that were developed as demonstrations/proof-of-concepts for different methods in digital palaeography. They were written primarily for a second-year course in the Digital Humanities master programme at University PSL, managed by the École National des Chartes. 
The course was co-taught by Chahan Vidal-Gorène and Peter Stokes, and the corresponding repository is [here](https://github.com/CVidalG/HN2-Paleographie-Computationnelle).

The code here is not robust nor particularly reliable, and is intended simply as a starting-point to demonstrate possibilities that could be developed into full projects.
